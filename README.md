# Javascript/Typescript Reusable Utilities

This is a collection of reusable utilities for Javascript and Typescript
functionalities. You can just copy and paste the code snippets into your
project, and it will work! **(trust me! 😆)**.

> :warning: **Warning** If you're using just JavaScript specific, you can remove
> the type anotations. But make sure that everything work correctly!

## Prerequisites (_If you would like to test_)

I used [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) which is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript and
TypeScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. So that I can
run the tests without needing to install any additional dependencies.

- [bun](https://bun.sh/) installed

### Installing dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
bun test # Run all tests
bun test --watch # Run tests in watch mode
bun test --coverage # Generate test coverage report
bun test --coverage --watch # Generate test coverage report in watch mode
```
